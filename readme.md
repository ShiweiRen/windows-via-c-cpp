# Windows via C/C++ 5th edition source code

Source code for Jeffrey Richter's [Windows via C/C++ 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-via-softcover-Developer-Reference/dp/0735663777). The source code is presented here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of the book authors.

The source code has been updated to target the latest Windows SDK and to also fix a bug in the old source code. The source successfully builds and compiles, but outdated compiler switches will generate warnings during the build. I'll address these when time permits.
