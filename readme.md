# Windows via C/C++ 5th edition source code

This is an unofficial source code repo for Jeffrey Richter and Christophe Nasarre's [Windows via C/C++ 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-via-softcover-Developer-Reference/dp/0735663777). The source code is presented here for convenience (so you don't need to dig up the physical media of the book) and remains the copyright of the book authors.

The source code has been updated to target the latest Windows SDK and to also fix a bug in the old source code. The source successfully compiles and builds, but outdated compiler switches will generate warnings during the build. These are a minor nuisance, and I'll update the switches when time permits.
